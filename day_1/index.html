                        I’ve just returned from an unforgettable journey to the Galápagos Islands and Ecuador, and I couldn’t wait to share all my incredible experiences. This trip has been one for the books—filled with stunning landscapes, extraordinary wildlife encounters, and some truly magical moments. 
                     Flight and Arrival in Quito: The adventure began with an early morning flight from London Heathrow on 10th March 2024. I flew with KLM from London to Amsterdam, before continuing to, Ecuador.
                     The layover in Amsterdam was brief, and the long-haul flight was surprisingly smooth, landing in Quito at 16:15 local time. Quito was my gateway to the Galápagos, and after a night's rest, I was ready to embark on the next leg of the journey. 
                     I flew from Quito to Baltra Island via Guayaquil.
                    </p>

                     Growing up, David Attenborough was the soundtrack of my childhood and the insipration of my curiosity. His narration carried through countless documentaries, each unveiling the wonder an complexity of the natural world.
                      When I finally set foot on the jetty waiting for a dingy to collect and transport me to the boat, that would be my floating home for the next week. 
                     Slighty sweaty from my short flight from Quito, Ecuador to Guayaquil and too excited to feel the slight shadow of exhaustion from an early flight and high altitude.

                     I find it hard to describe for you guys exactly how it felt looking out at the vast sea ahead, to 3 boats, for gaggles of tourists excursions, similar to mine, bobing about anchored, waiting.
                     As I shuffle on my bright orange life jacket I let my mind wander, my inner child in disbelief at the fact that I'm lucky enough to be here in the first place. I felt as though if I turned my head the frames of a TV may come into
                     view and shatter the illusion at any moment yet as I clipped myself in and took the hand of the Crew to steady myself it finally started to set in that I was indeed truly here! 
                     That this trip would be a chance to see firsthand the wildlife I had admired through a screen.
                     <p>
                     I boarded the beautiful Solaris, my floating home for the next six days. The Solaris crew was welcoming, and the first meal on board set the tone for the days ahead delicious and fresh.
                     Our first stop was Bachas Beach on Santa Cruz Island, a peaceful spot where I first encountered Galápagos wildlife. I strolled along the beach, where I saw playful Sally Lightfoot crabs and, much to my delight, some Pacific green turtles swimming near the shore. It was such a serene introduction to the islands, with the sun setting as we sailed overnight to Isabela Island. Snorkelling with Sea Turtles and Vibrant Marine Life The highlight of the trip came the next day, during a morning snorkelling session off the Tintoreras Islets near Isabela Island. As I swam through the crystal-clear waters, I found myself surrounded by sea turtles, peacefully gliding through the water. It was a surreal moment, and one I’ll never forget. The waters were teeming with life, and I got to see beautifully coloured fishes darting between the corals—each one more vibrant than the last. I also spotted white-tip reef sharks lazily swimming below me, and though they’re harmless, it was thrilling to be so close to these majestic creatures. Snorkelling in the Galápagos truly feels like you’re in another world.

                        <h4>Exploring Isabela Island</h4>
                    <p>
                        From Tortoises to The Wall of Tears After snorkelling, I returned to the Solaris for breakfast before heading out to explore Puerto Villamil. 
                        This small, charming town is home to the tortoise breeding centre, where I saw these gentle giants up close. Their slow, deliberate movements were mesmerizing, and learning about their conservation was inspiring. In the afternoon, we visited the historic Wall of Tears, a haunting yet fascinating site built by prisoners in the island’s penal colony during the mid-20th century. The wall stands as a reminder of a dark past, but it is now surrounded by lush wetlands, where I spotted American Flamingos wading gracefully in the water.

                        Lava Fields and Wildlife on Moreno Point On 14th March, I found myself hiking across the black lava fields of Moreno Point.
                        The rugged, moon-like landscape stretched for miles, creating a stark contrast to the greenery and wildlife surrounding it. 
                        As I trekked through this dramatic environment, I was constantly in awe of how diverse the Galápagos Islands are. 
                        Every stop had something new to offer, from volcanic rock formations to rich wetland ecosystems. 
                        Cruising, Wildlife, and Stunning Sunsets Each night aboard the Solaris, we anchored in different locations around the islands. 
                        The sunsets were something I looked forward to every evening, watching the sky turn brilliant shades of orange and pink as we prepared for our next adventure. 
                        The journey continued as we explored more of Isabela Island’s western coast, each day filled with new wildlife sightings, relaxing moments on board, and shared stories with fellow travellers.
                        From watching sea lions bask in the sun to spotting marine iguanas lounging on the rocks, I truly felt immersed in the untouched beauty of the Galápagos. 
                        Returning to the Mainland On 18th March, it was time to say goodbye to the Galápagos as we sailed back to Baltra for my flight to Guayaquil. Though I was sad to leave, the memories of this adventure will stay with me forever. 
                        After a smooth flight from Guayaquil to Quito, and an overnight stay, I began my long journey back to London via Amsterdam.

                        This trip exceeded all my expectations. 
                        The landscapes were like nothing I’d ever seen before, and the wildlife encounters were nothing short of magical. 
                        From snorkeling with sea turtles to hiking across ancient lava fields, every moment was filled with awe and wonder.
                        If you ever get the chance to visit this extraordinary part of the world, take it. 
                        The Galápagos Islands are truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
